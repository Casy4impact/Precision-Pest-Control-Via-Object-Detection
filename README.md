# Precision-Pest-Control-Via-Object-Detection
EnviroPest Solutions, like many others in the pest control industry, faces significant inefficiencies using traditional methods. These challenges negatively affect their operational efficiency, environmental safety, and client satisfaction.
 ## Key Issues:
1.	Inefficient Inspections â€“ Manual approaches are error-prone, time-consuming, and unsuitable for wide coverage.
2.	Suboptimal Resource Allocation â€“ Lack of real-time pest data leads to poor targeting and waste.
3.	Environmental Impact â€“ Excessive or misplaced pesticide application harms the ecosystem.
4.	Customer Dissatisfaction â€“ Delayed pest identification frustrates clients and reduces retention.
